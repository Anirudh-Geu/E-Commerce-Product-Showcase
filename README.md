üõçÔ∏è Premium E-Commerce Product Showcase
Developed by: ANIRUDH CHOUDHARY

This project is a modern, responsive, and aesthetically pleasing front-end implementation of an e-commerce product showcase. It is designed to demonstrate proficiency in core web development technologies, focusing on dynamic content display, filtering, search functionality, and an engaging user experience.

‚ú® Features
Dynamic Product Grid: Products are loaded from a static JavaScript array and rendered dynamically on the page.

Interactive Filtering: Easily filter products by categories (Electronics, Fashion, Home, Sports).

Live Search: Instantly filter the product list by searching product names or descriptions.

Shopping Cart Simulation: Functionality to add items to a temporary cart, view cart contents, and proceed to a basic checkout form.

Responsive Design: Fully adaptive layout using CSS @media queries to ensure optimal viewing on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

Premium UI/UX: Utilizes advanced CSS for a modern look, including gradient text clipping, smooth hover transitions (cubic-bezier), and custom animations for loading and modal displays.

Detailed Product Modals: Clicking a product opens a detailed modal view with an overview and feature list.

üíª Technology Stack
This project is built purely using front-end technologies and requires no backend server:

HTML5: Structure and semantic markup.

CSS3: Styling, responsiveness, animations, and custom UI effects.

JavaScript (ES6): Core logic for product management, filtering, searching, and cart operations.

Font Awesome: Used for essential UI icons (Cart, Search, Close, etc.).
